Rationale

Course Aims and outcomes

OPTIONAL Title IX wording for your syllabus:

Bard College is committed to fostering a safe, productive learning environment. Title IX and our school policy prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex regarding gender-misconduct — including harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. We understand that sexual violence can undermine students’ academic success and we encourage students who have experienced some form of sexual misconduct to talk to someone about their experience, so they can get the support they need.  A complete list of confidential and non-confidential resources can be found at www.bard.edu/titleix.  Alleged violations can be non-confidentially reported to the Office for Gender Equity at TitleIX@bard.edu or 845-758-7542.


REQUIRED Academic Integrity Statement for your syllabus

Citizen Science adheres to Bard’s policies on academic dishonesty and plagiarism, which can be found in the student handbook, and online at: http://www.bard.edu/undergraduate/requirements/.  All students are bound by these policies, and are expected to always act in an ethical and honest manner with regard to their academic work. The work done in Citizen Science should be your own. Any ideas or work that you use which are not your own should be clearly attributed to the source. If you are unsure if you are providing appropriate or sufficient citation, you should contact the professor before submitting the final draft of the assignment.
