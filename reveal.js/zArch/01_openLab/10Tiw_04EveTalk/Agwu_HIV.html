			The HIV Epidemic: Improving outcomes for adolescent youths (Alison Agwu)
		</h1>
		<blockquote style="position: absolute; left: 0%; width: 45%; font-size: 100%;">
			Over thirty years into the HIV epidemic, tools exist to prevent and control the virus and for persons living with HIV to have a normal life span. However, despite these advances, certain groups, particularly adolescents and young adults are disproportionately being impacted, having higher rates of infection and poorer outcomes once infected. We will discuss the complexities of youth from a biologic, psychosocial, and developmental context, explore their increased risk for HIV, discuss disparities in HIV diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. Further, we will assess the priorities and unfilled gaps for clinical care and research to optimize outcomes for this population.
