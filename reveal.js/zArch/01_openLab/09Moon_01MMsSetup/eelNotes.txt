Order of business:
RULES OF THE GAME

Write Freedom / Respect / Diversity + Narrative/Resistance

How to address me:
	You can choose to address me as Juan or Dr. Angueyra, because I believe that the main driver between our interaction is respect. For this same reason, when we address other faculty, we will use Dr. unless they give us express permission to do otherwise.
	My preferred pronouns are he/him.

Go around class and make introductions and preferred pronouns + expectations about CitizenScience

Syllabus:
	Any questions? Things unclear? Changes?
	We will make classroom spaces into labs, which are a sacred spaces because they require free-interaction to work. First thing we are going to do today is to define our own rules of engagament in lab:
	Then sign informed Consent

15 minutes of code? Processing? Optional


Go over homework

TSM:
	Rational

Weaknesses of TSM:
	Only addresses the how things work, not the why thigs are the way they are
	Only is concerned wth physical phenomena
	Scientists are humans and prone to bias
	Data is intepreted (human error)
	Science is inductive, so never 100% sure (proof)
